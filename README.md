  A Simple Shell is a Basic UNIX-like shell implementation in C programming for ALX Software Engineering course.
  A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system.
  A simple shell is a basic implementation of a shell that typically includes a limited set of commands and features.
  You can type commands, and it will execute them for you. The commands may include basic utilities such as ls, cd, and echo,
  as well as basic programming constructs such as if/else statements and loops.
  
# Features
. Built-in commands
. Basic shell functionality

# Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

# Then, to start the shell, run:

./hsh

# Testing
